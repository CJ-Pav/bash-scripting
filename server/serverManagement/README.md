Not for distribution.

Based on setup with one 'master' server/computer and multiple other devices to back up.
- This setup contains 2 cell phone backups, 4-6 Linux machine backups, 1 server backup, 4 windows machine backups,
  1 master copy of the backups belonging to me personally (can be duplicated for any user easily)
